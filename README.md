# The-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-Fuzz (In Progress)

Implementation of various Fuzzy Search Algorithms for String Matching

# Dataset

- The dataset's 'Consolidated Codes' sheet contains codes for sevral products.
- The objective of this repository is to link all the data in 'Dynamic Data' sheet to its respective 'Code' and 'Description'

## Workflow

- Libraries
    - Select required Libraries
- Required Functions
    - Created Functions for Data cleaning, standardizing, stop word removal, punctuation removal and spelling correction.
- Data Loading
- Data Pre-Processing
    - Removing case sensitivity
    - Test Data standardization
        - Cleaning:
            - Convert 'pct' to '%'
            - Convert 'ppm' to '%'
            - Removal of numbers with metrics
    - Some more Cleaning
        - Stop Word Removal
        - Spell Correction
- Model Comparison
    - Sample Selection from Test Set
    - Model 1
    - Model 2
    - Model 3
    - Model 4
    - Model 5
    - Model Selection
        - Model Prediction
- Results
    - Save Output in an Excel Format
